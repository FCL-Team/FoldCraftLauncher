	 * The getCapabilities() method is a potential hot spot in any LWJGL application, since
	 * it is needed for context capability discovery (e.g. is OpenGL 2.0 supported?), and
	 * for the function pointers of gl functions. However, the 'current_capabilities' ThreadLocal
	 * is (relatively) expensive to look up, and since most OpenGL applications use are single threaded
	 * rendering, the following two is an optimization for this case.
	 * <p/>
	 * ThreadLocals can be thought of as a mapping between threads and values, so the idea
	 * is to use a lock-less cache of mappings between threads and the current ContextCapabilities. The cache
	 * could be any size, but in our case, we want a single sized cache for optimal performance
	 * in the single threaded case.
	 * <p/>
	 * 'fast_path_cache' is the most recent ContextCapabilities (potentially null) and its owner. By
	 * recent I mean the last thread setting the value in setCapabilities(). When getCapabilities()
	 * is called, a check to see if the current is the owner of the ContextCapabilities instance in
	 * fast_path_cache. If so, the instance is returned, if not, some thread has since taken ownership
	 * of the cache entry and the slower current_capabilities ThreadLocal is queried instead.
	 * <p/>
	 * No locks are needed in get/setCapabilities, because even though fast_path_cache can be accessed
	 * from multiple threads at once, we are guaranteed by the JVM spec that its value is always valid.
	 * Furthermore, if the ownership test in getCapabilities() succeeds, the cache entry can only contain
	 * the correct ContextCapabilites (that is, the one from getThreadLocalCapabilites()),
	 * since no other thread can set the owner to anyone else than itself.
