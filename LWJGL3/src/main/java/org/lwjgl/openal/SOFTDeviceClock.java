/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal-extensions/SOFT_device_clock.txt">SOFT_device_clock</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows applications to query the timing clock from the audio device. This clock lets applications measure the passage of time as the
 * audio device sees it, which may be slightly different than the system clock's tick rate (the infamous timer drift).</p>
 * 
 * <p>If the {@link SOFTPauseDevice SOFT_pause_device} extension is available, the device clock does not increment while the device playback is paused. It is
 * implementation-defined whether or not the device clock increments while no contexts are allocated. The initial clock time value of an opened device is
 * also implementation-defined, except that it must not be negative and should be low enough to avoid wrapping during program execution.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link SOFTSourceLatency SOFT_source_latency}</p>
