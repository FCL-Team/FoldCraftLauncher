 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal-extensions/SOFT_deferred_updates.txt">SOFT_deferred_updates</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows applications to defer playback state updates. With unextended OpenAL, the playback state would respond to changes as soon as it
 * could handle them, which makes it effectively impossible to ensure multiple changes occur at the same time without the potential of a "partial" update
 * (where one change is heard without the other). This extension provides a way to prevent state updates from occuring until they've all been done, where
 * they will all apply at once.</p>
